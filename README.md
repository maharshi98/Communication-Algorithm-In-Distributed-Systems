# Distributed-Systems
 
In this project, I have implemented 2 algorithms - Gossip and PushSum using the concepts of Distributed Computing. The language used is Elixir.

Topologies such as Line, Star, HoneyComb, 2D, 3D-Torus have been implemented and the convergence rate of each of these topologies have been analysed and compared.
